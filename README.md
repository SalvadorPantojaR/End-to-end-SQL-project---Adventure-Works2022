# AdventureWorks Top Customers Analysis

In this project I simulated an **executive sales report** scenario:
1. Built a scalar UDF to calculate **product profit margin**.
2. Designed a **territory-level performance view** with revenue and order counts.
3. Used **temporary tables** to isolate category-level revenues.
4. Created multiple **CTEs** to find:
   - Top customers by spending
   - Their favorite purchase month
   - Most profitable category
   - Leading territory
   - Best-selling product
5. Compiled everything into a **Top 5 Customer Report**.

The final query provides a 360° customer profile — useful for decision-makers in sales and marketing.

**Takeaway:** This project demonstrates how SQL can power advanced analytics and deliver actionable insights from raw transactional data.
